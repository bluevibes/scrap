a computer provides two fundamental operations:
1. calculation
2. storage

Statements of facts give us true, but, as we'll see, they don't necessarily help us think about how to find new information.
Imperative knowledge, how to methods or recipes, give us ways of finding new information.

fixed program computer : performs only one type of calculation - calculator
stored program computer : performs calculations based on a pinstructions listed in a sequence of program 

heron of alexandria : square root of a number by guessing

exhaustive enumeration : traversing all possible values one by one to reach to the answer.

bisection search : divide and conquer

newton raphson root finding : uses derivatives to find root

Turing complete : language/computational engine that can solve any type of computational problem. The runtime and size is not a limitation.
