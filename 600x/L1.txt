a computer provides two fundamental operations:
1. calculation
2. storage

Statements of facts give us true, but, as we'll see, they don't necessarily help us think about how to find new information.
Imperative knowledge, how to methods or recipes, give us ways of finding new information.

fixed program computer : performs only one type of calculation - calculator
stored program computer : performs calculations based on a pinstructions listed in a sequence of program 

heron of alexandria : square root of a number by guessing

exhaustive enumeration : traversing all possible values one by one to reach to the answer.

bisection search : divide and conquer

newton raphson root finding : uses derivatives to find root

Turing complete : language/computational engine that can solve any type of computational problem. The runtime and size is not a limitation.

Kinds of problems that computer cannot do :
1. vague      - cannot be well formulated by humans
2. difficult  - restricted by the technology and limitations of present. May be solved in the future.
3. expensive  - problems that consume near infinite resources(time, space etc) to crack
4. impossible - cannot be solved due tofundamental restrictions on computation

Turing Primitives - with these any Turing complete problem can be programmed :
Right: Move the Machine’s head to the right of the current square
Left: Move the Machine’s head to the left of the current square
Print: Print a symbol on the current square
Scan: Identify any symbols on the current square
Erase: Erase any symbols presented o the current square
Nothing: Do nothing
