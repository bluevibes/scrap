Recursion : recursive step = reduce the problem to a simpler version of the same problem plus some computations
            base step      = keep reducing until reach a simple case that can be solved directly

euclid's method of finding gcd:
    def gcdRecur(a, b):
        '''
        a, b: positive integers
        
        returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.
        '''
        if b==0:
            return a
        else:
            return gcdRecur(b, a%b)
