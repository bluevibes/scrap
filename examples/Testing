Black-box testing is a method of software testing that tests the functionality of an application. Recall from the lecture that a way to think about black-box testing is to look at both:
1. The possible paths through the specification.
2. The possible boundary cases.

For glass-box testing, you actually know how the function you are testing is defined. Thus you can use this definition to figure out how many different paths through the code exist, and then pick a test suite based on that knowledge. Path-complete glass box test suite would find test cases that go through every possible path in the code. This is different from black-box testing, because in black-box testing you only have the function specification.
