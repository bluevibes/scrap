TIPS
----
/dev/null : ideal sink for any not required data , if tried to read from it, returns end of file
/dev/tty : output to tty
the order of the options does not matter as long as the commands are mutually exclusive
umask set the default file permission . if umask=022 then default file permission is 644 for file and 755 for directory
IFS by default is whitespace. Can change it during a script /terminal for the life time of that script/terminal.
Shell builtins are described in manpage of bash
Redirection is done before the command is executed and thus a file cant be both input and output source and sink respectively.

TRICKS
------
SCRIPTPATH=$( cd $(dirname $0) ; pwd -P ) to get the path of a scipt in a foolproof way.
stty -echo : removes echo of the input from user (like when entering passwords in terminal)
UNIVERSAL SHORTCUTS : ALT+[n] -> the tab of nth number, CTRL+ALT+[NUMPAD] to reset the window position
TERMINAL WINDOW RESIZE : select a window in terminal by ctrl+w. increase/decrease font size by ctrl+w+(+/-)
WINDOWS/LINUX: A line ends with a carriage return and a line feed in windows whereas in linux a line ends only with a line feed
arrfqdn=(${fqdn//./ }) : split fqdn on . and store as array
DEBUGGING : trace commands set -x (unset using set +x)
LINE CONTINUATION : use \ to allow multiple lines of statements to treated as a single line. \ tells bash to ignore the new line.
