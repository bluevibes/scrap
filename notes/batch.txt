DOS is basically a file called command.com
This contains certain built in commands - internal commands
We can create batch files that can be classified as external commands.
Batch file is executed in batch mode : where the command.com opens and reads a line from batch file, then closes it and executes the command for every line in batch file.
Any command will be first searched in internal command's collection and then in the external commands.
Remark : remark tool
echo <string>: batch printing tool. without the string it shows whether echo is on or off. leave a line blank in bat to print blank line.
echo off : prevent batch from displaying the commands benig executed
@echo off : do not even display echo off
pause : freeze time
