globally regular expression print
-n = print the line number from the matched file in the result(grep -n <str> file)
-v = print the negative result/complement of what was matched 
-c = print just the number of lines that were matched in the query
-l = print the names of the files that contains the word (grep -l <string> *)
-L = print the names of the files that don't match the string (opp of -l)
-i = make the search case insensitive
-o = only matched part is displayed and display on separate lines
-x = print if the the string matches with the entire line
-q = print nothing to stdout. exit with 0 status if match found else with 1
-G = for basic regular expression
-E = for extended regular expressions
-H = the output lines with filename(default in case of multiple file input)
-h = suppress the filename in the o/p lines(default in case of single file input)
-A = followed by num that denotes the number of lines after a match to be printed
-B = followed by num that denotes the number of lines before the match 
-C = same as -AB
-r = read all files under each dir.dont follow symbolic links
-R = -r + read the symbolic links
-w = search for exact word and not for substring
-b = offset in terms of bytes is displayed from the file' beginning
-e = matching multiple terms

example : grep -rl "somestring" <path>  # search for the somestring in evry path under path
