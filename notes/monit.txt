---------------------------
|| INTRODUCTION TO MONIT ||
---------------------------
Monit is a free open source and very useful tool that automatically monitors and manages server process, files, directories, checksums, permissions, filesystems and services like Apache, Nginx, MySQL, FTP, SSH, Sendmail and so on in a UNIX/Linux based systems and provides an excellent and helpful monitoring functionality to system administrators.

Monit has a ability to start a process if it is not running, restart a process if not responding and stop a process if uses high resources. Additionally you can also use Monit to Monitor files, directories and filesystems for changes, checksum changes, file size changes or timestamp changes. With Monit you can monitor remote hosts TCP/IP port, server protocols and ping. Monit keeps its own log file and alerts about any critical error conditions and recovery status.

----------------------------
|| COMMAND LINE FOR MONIT ||
----------------------------

-c file
  Use this control file

-d n
  Run Monit as a daemon once per n seconds. Or use "set
  daemon" in monitrc.

-g name
  Set group name for start, stop, restart, monitor and
  unmonitor action.

-l logfile
  Print log information to this file. Or use "set logfile"
   in monitrc.

-p pidfile
  Use this lock file in daemon mode. Or use "set pidfile"
   in monitrc.

-s statefile
  Write state information to this file. Or use "set
  statefile" in monitrc.

-I
  Do not run in background (needed for run from init)

-t
  Run syntax check for the control file

-v
  Verbose mode, work noisy (diagnostic output)

-----------------------
|| CONFIGURING MONIT ||
-----------------------
It is prefered to do the configuration using a file. The main configuration file/control file of monit located at:
1. Sytem wide : /etc/monit.conf (RedHat/CentOS/Fedora) and /etc/monit/monitrc (Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint).
2. User wide : ~/.monitrc 

After changing the conf file do following :
a. Check syntax : monit -t
b. Restart monit : 'monit start all' OR 'monit reload'

1. Monit configurations
By default, it is set up to check that services are running every 2 minutes and stores its log file in “/var/log/monit.log”.
These settings can be altered at the beginning of the configuration file in the set daemon and set logfile lines respectively.

The monit has user friendly web interface where you can directly view the system status and setup up processes using native HTTP(S) web server or via the command line interface. A web server like Apache or Nginx should be installed on your system to access and view monit web interface. You can control the programs through both the web interface or the command line. Following is the sample configuration block for this:

set httpd port 2812 and     # port can be chaged to any other port
     use address localhost  # only accept connection from localhost
     allow localhost        # allow localhost to connect to the server and
     allow admin:monit      # require user 'admin' with password 'monit'
     allow @monit           # allow users of group 'monit' to connect (rw)
     allow @users readonly  # allow users of group 'users' to connect readonly

2. Monitor a service/file
Following are a few the sample configuration block for this :

######## NGINX

check process nginx with pidfile /var/run/nginx.pid
    start program = "/etc/init.d/nginx start"
    stop program  = "/etc/init.d/nginx stop"
    group www-data (for ubuntu, debian)

######## HTTPD

check process httpd with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
    group apache
    start program = "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
    stop program = "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
    if failed host 127.0.0.1 port 80
    protocol http then restart
    if 5 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout

######## SSHD

check process sshd with pidfile /var/run/sshd.pid
    start program "/etc/init.d/sshd start"
    stop program "/etc/init.d/sshd stop"
    if failed host 127.0.0.1 port 22 protocol ssh then restart
    if 5 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout

######## MYSQL

check process mysql with pidfile /opt/mysql/data/myserver.mydomain.pid
   group database
   start program = "/etc/init.d/mysql start"
   stop program = "/etc/init.d/mysql stop"
   if failed host 192.168.1.1 port 3306 protocol mysql then restart
   depends on mysql_bin
   depends on mysql_rc

check file mysql_bin with path /opt/mysql/bin/mysqld
   group database
   if failed checksum then unmonitor
   if failed permission 755 then unmonitor
   if failed uid root then unmonitor
   if failed gid root then unmonitor

check file mysql_rc with path /etc/init.d/mysql
   group database
   if failed checksum then unmonitor
   if failed permission 755 then unmonitor
   if failed uid root then unmonitor
   if failed gid root then unmonitor

######## CPU TEMPERATURE

#Monitor CPU Temperature mbmon required
check program CPU with path "/usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/cpu_temp.sh"
   if status > 60 then alert
   group temperature

#Script /usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/cpu_temp.sh
#!/bin/sh
TP=`mbmon -c 1 -r | grep TEMP1 | awk '{ printf "%d",$3 }'`
#echo $TP
exit $TP
#Note: Read about mbmon before use it. It can crash your system.

#Here is another idea for gathering the CPU Temperature with coretemp rather than (x)mbmon:
#Script /usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/cpu_temp_2.sh
#!/bin/sh
TP=`/sbin/sysctl -a | grep dev.cpu.0.temperature | awk '{print substr($2,0,2)}'`
#echo $TP
exit $TP
#Note: Don't forget to load the kernel module coretemp 

######## SAMBA

check process smbd with pidfile /opt/samba2.2/var/locks/smbd.pid
   group samba
   start program = "/etc/init.d/smbd start"
   stop  program = "/etc/init.d/smbd stop"
   if failed host 192.168.1.1 port 139 type TCP  then restart
   depends on smbd_bin

check file smbd_bin with path /opt/samba2.2/sbin/smbd
   group samba
   if failed checksum then unmonitor
   if failed permission 755 then unmonitor
   if failed uid root then unmonitor
   if failed gid root then unmonitor

   if failed permission 755 then unmonitor
   if failed uid root then unmonitor
   if failed gid root then unmonitor

######## APACHE

check process apache with pidfile /opt/apache_misc/logs/httpd.pid
   group www
   start program = "/etc/init.d/apache start"
   stop  program = "/etc/init.d/apache stop"
   if failed host localhost port 80 
        protocol HTTP request "/~hauk/monit/token" then restart
   if failed host 192.168.1.1 port 443 type TCPSSL 
        certmd5 12-34-56-78-90-AB-CD-EF-12-34-56-78-90-AB-CD-EF
