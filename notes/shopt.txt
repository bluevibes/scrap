shopt [-pqsu] [-o] [optname â€¦]
shopt : toggle between various shell options
      : typing only shopt gives the status if all the optnames

options are:
-s : Enable (set) each optname.
-u : Disable (unset) each optname.
-q : Suppresses normal output; the return status indicates whether the optname is set or unset.
-o : Restricts the values of optname to be those defined for the -o option to the set builtin

some optnames are :
autocd : to automatically switch to directory path typed without typing cd
cdable_vars : an argument to the cd builtin command that is not a directory is assumed to be the name of a variable whose value is the directory to change to.
cdspell : minor errors (transposed/missing/repetitive character) in the spelling of a directory component in a cd command will be corrected. (interactive shells only)
cmdhist : Bash attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the same history entry. This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands.
expand_aliases : aliases are expanded (interactive shells only)
interactive_comments : allow using # to comment the following characters till the end of the line
login_shell : set by the shell if it is a login shell
restricted_shell : it is set when a shell is initiated using rbash (restrictive bash) and cannot be set manually
xpg_echo : enable or disable expansion of escape characters (\a,\n,\t..). Off by default hence the characters wont be expanded
