/etc/sudoers file stores all the information for locking down access and privileges to resources.
Any configuration below will overwrite configuration above it. So add the changes to the end of the file.
sudo actions are logged : "grep 'sudo:' /var/log/*" to get the logfile 
editing sudoers should be done using visudo command

Defaults:
  listing default settings : sudo -l
  Timestamps:
    set default timeout for users to use sudo without password : Defaults:ALL timestamp_timeout=15
    reset active timestamp : sudo -k
  Environments:
    env_reset

Giving users privileges:
  USER HOST=(RUNAS) [NOPASSWD:|PASSWD:|NOEXEC:]COMMANDS
    USER     : username to which grant permissions.
    HOST     : comma separated list of hostnames. ip addresses/hostname for which this entry is applicable. ALL is mostly used in its place.
    RUNAS    : comma separated list of usernames. USER can run as any of the RUNAS. Left empty usually that defaults to root.
    COMMANDS : comma separated list of commands. USER can only run these COMMANDS.
    NOPASSWD : user wont be prompted for a password when sudoing. Default is PASSWD.
    NOEXEC   : prevents programs listed in COMMANDS from shelling out. Example of shelling out : vim allows users to run a bash COMMAND with :!COMMAND
    example1 : <operator ALL= /sbin/poweroff>. Here ALL is similar to * in regex.
    example2 : <ray ALL = (root, bin : operator, system) /bin/ls, /bin/kill>. Ray is allowed to run /bin/ls and /bin/kill as root/bin, possibly with additional operator or system groups privileges.

Giving groups privileges:
  %GROUP HOST=(USERS) [NOPASSWD:|PASSWD:]COMMANDS
    GROUP    : groupname to which this applies
    
Aliases:
  User_Alias     techs   = dick, harry
  Runas_Alias    admins  = root, operator
  Host_Alias     office  = 11.7.22.0/255.255.255.0
  Cmnd_Alias     install = /usr/bin/apt-get, /usr/bin/yum, /usr/bin/pip, /usr/bin/easy-install
  
  These aliases can replace the usual names.
